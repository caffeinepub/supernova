  "summary": "The diff implements a photo-upload UI in the composer and adds a single optional photo field to backend QueryEntry with frontend plumbing to send/store/render one photo per user message. However, several requirements are only partially met: multi-image attachments are not supported end-to-end (backend/model/API/hooks are single-photo), attachment metadata (bytes/content-type/filename) is not clearly stored, and the file picker’s format restriction is not evidenced. The diff also contains multiple unrelated features and UI changes not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Clicking the upload control opens a file picker limited to common image formats (png, jpg/jpeg, webp).",
      "reason": "The composer filters selected files by MIME type after selection, but the diff summary does not show the input element being configured with an `accept` attribute (or equivalent) to limit the picker to the required formats.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Support sending chat messages with optional uploaded photos (one or more), rendering the photo(s) inline in the thread and when loading history.",
      "reason": "The composer supports selecting multiple photos, but the persistence and history rendering appear to support only a single photo (`entry.photo`) per QueryEntry. App history loading maps only `entry.photo` into a single-element `photos` array, and hooks/backend types are single-photo as well.",

      "requirement": "Backend QueryEntry includes an optional list of photo attachments including at least bytes and content-type (plus filename if available), and API/hook supports optional attachments list.",
      "reason": "Backend `QueryEntry` has `photo : ?BlobRef` (single, not list) and `BlobRef` contains `id` and `blob` but no explicit content-type or filename field. Frontend mutation accepts only `photo?: File` and passes a single `BlobRef` to `addQueryEntry`.",
