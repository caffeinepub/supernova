  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented via a structured cooking response formatter with a cookie-baking fallback template, plus new snippet cleanup/normalization utilities and improved partial-failure handling for cooking queries. However, the diff summary also introduces multiple unrelated product features (guest mode, speech I/O, UI restyling, photo upload, etc.) that were not requested in the BuildRequest.",
